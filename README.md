## Welcome to this pedagogic project :)



#Frontend:

We will run react there.
React documentation : https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
To go further(not useful yet I guess) : https://overreacted.io/

#Backend

Here will be an API based on Phoenix (upon elixir) and Ecto as an ORM (object-relational mapping).
Dunno yet for database. 


#One golden rule:
You cannot require a file/ressources directly from the frontend repository if you work on backend and vice-versa.
But the good side by having both in one repository, is that you will be able to do a signle Pull Request when you would like to push a feature that modifies front and back.
